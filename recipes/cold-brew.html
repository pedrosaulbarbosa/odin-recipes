    <p><strong>Prep: </strong>10 mins</p>
    <p><strong>Cook: </strong>2 hrs</p>
    <p><strong>Total: </strong>2 hrs 10 mins</p>
    <p><strong>Servings: </strong>8</p>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup coarsely ground coffee</li>
        <li>4 (16-ounce) Mason jars</li>
        <li>8 cups water</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place 1/4 cup coffee grounds into each jar, then top with water. Screw on the lids until just barely tightened; do not overtighten.</li>
        <li>Fill a large pot with enough water to cover the jars completely and place a sous vide immersion cooker into the water. Set temperature to 150 degrees F (65 degrees C) according to manufacturer's directions.</li>
        <li>Submerge mason jars into the water bath and set timer for 2 hours.        </li>
        <li>Remove jars to a cooling rack and let cool until easily handled. Strain the mixture through a coffee filter to stop the steeping process. Pour over ice and serve, or return to rinsed-out jars and store in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Cook's Notes</h4>
    <p>Feel free to use any size jars, but keep the 1:8 coffee to water ratio in mind. For a 32-ounce quart-size jar, use 4 cups of water and 1/2 cup of coffee grounds.    </p>
    <p>For a lighter brew, set timer for 1 1/2 hours. For a more concentrated brew, set timer for 2 1/2 hours.</p>
